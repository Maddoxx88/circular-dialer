## Introduction

This was inspired by the reaallllly old Rotary Dial Telephones. So, I thought of replicating that into an app which everyone could use on a daily basis. If you're someone who is good with remembering phone numbers this app might suffice your needs of calling. 

**Available ONLY for Android.**

## Features

* Rotary Dial Mechanism 
* Direct Call without switching to your primary dial-pad
* Temporary Contacts [TO BE ADDED]
* Other awesome features yet to be implemented

## Packages Used

- [flutter_circular_slider](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_circular_slider) - The Rotary Dial was made possible because of this package.
- [flutter_phone_direct_caller](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_phone_direct_caller) - To bypass calling from the primary dial-pad of your Phone app.
